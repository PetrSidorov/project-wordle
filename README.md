# Word Game

In this project, I recreated a popular online word game, Wordle:

![Screen recording showing the guess being entered. It gets logged to the console, and erased from the input](docs/submit-guess.gif)
![Screen recording showing each guess printed out above the text input from the last exercise](docs/printed-word-list.gif)
